Want to start your [Play 2](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/Home) development, but don't feel like dealing with all the extra fluff that comes with [the starter projects](https://playframework.com/download#starters) or the example applications?

# The minimal setup for a Play framework 2.6.6 project

* Install [Sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/index.html)
  * MacOS: `brew install sbt`
* Clone this repo
* In the root of this repo: `sbt`
* In the Sbt console that just opened: `run`
* See [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
